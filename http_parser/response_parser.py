        The utility of this function is that urlopen.info() returns these information
            as a mime tools.Message instance which isnâ€™t as easy to use an dictionary.
        Each item from an .info() call is split and added to a dictionary as a key value pair.

        :type response: HTTPresponse object

        :returns a dictionary with response headers and other meta-information depending on the webpage.
